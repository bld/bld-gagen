Package to generate efficient geometric algebras
================================================

Uses symbolic BLD-GA to expand expressions of sub-classes to generate
fast code for the basic geometric algebra functions. Uses macros to
generate code. Also has code-generation functions, which are
optional. Packages using this can define fast functions on-the-fly.
