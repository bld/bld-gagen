Package to generate efficient geometric algebras
================================================

Uses symbolic BLD-GA to expand expressions of sub-classes to generate
fast code for the basic geometric algebra functions. WRITE-GA-FILES is
the primary function, used to create a set of files with a specified
geometric algebra and methods between specific sub-classes for speed.
